### HTML Structure

- A `main` div element to hold the application content.
- An `h2` element to display the application title.
- A `search-results` div to display the fetched car images.
- A "Get Cars" button with the ID `searchButton` to trigger the image fetch.

### CSS Styling

- Styles to make the application visually appealing.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
- CSS transitions for image hover effects.

### JavaScript Functionality
